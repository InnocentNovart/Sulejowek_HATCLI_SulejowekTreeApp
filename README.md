# About Hack The Climate Hackathon 2023
Hack the Climate is an educational project using international cooperation and new technologies to fight climate change
affecting cities. The program implemented by the Polish Development Fund together with the Norwegian organization Nordic Edge
aims to build a bridge between Polish and Norwegian local governments and create an effective platform for exchanging knowledge in the field of green transformation.

In this year's hackathon, 4 cities were looking for digital solutions for green transformation in different aspects of their cities' development. The cities were
Setesdal and Stavanger from Norway; and Rzeszów, Bieruń, and Sulejówek from Poland.
